    "# An agile kickstart with OpenAI for business analysis\n",
    "Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) tools can significantly expedite the business analysis process. By utilizing advanced AI models like GPT, analysts and developers can quickly analyze problem statements, define high-level features and objectives, and generate epics and user stories. AI tools that can streamline requirements gathering can save time and effort while enabling the development of structured and organized analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored how OpenAI's ChatGPT can be leveraged to kickstart the business analysis process to do rapid requirement gathering. You can [read about the methods and tools used for experimentation](./an_experiment_with_generative_ai%20copy.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business analysis process starts with identifying a problem statement and then listing out the high-level business objectives or requirements. With the help of OpenAI chat completion api's in Python, we were able to engage in an interactive conversation, quickly generating ideas and requirements to kickstart the analysis process.\n",

    "## Generating Epics and Stories with Prompt Engineering: Customizing AI for Consistent Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Epics and stories are key components of  breaking down complex projects into manageable units. During the initial analysis phase, epics are identified from the high-level features, which are further broken down into stories. Subsequently, acceptance criteria are written at the story level;  telling us specific details to know when we are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used ChatGPT to identify the 3 high-level business objectives for a time tracking application. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement was given as a prompt\n",
    "> Identify top 3 features of a time tracking app for employees to enter work hours against projects so reports can be generated regarding billable hours and then invoices can be created for the billable hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT identified the following 3 high level features:\n",
    ">1. Time Entry and Tracking: The app should have an easy-to-use interface that allows employees to enter their work hours quickly and accurately. The app should also have a timer feature that enables employees to track the time they spend on each project.\n",
    ">2. Reporting: The app should be able to generate detailed reports on the time spent on each project and task, including billable and non-billable hours, and total time spent. These reports should be customizable, allowing for filtering and sorting based on different criteria.\n",
    ">3. Invoicing: The app should be able to create invoices for the billable hours worked on each project. The invoices should be customizable and allow for different billing rates and payment terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using prompt engineering techniques, we used these high level features to generate epics and stories.  A technique we found helpful was to build a context around how we wanted our epics and stories and acceptance-criterias to be written. Every business analyst will follow a structure and format while writing an epic or a story. Although the GPT model knows what an epic or user-story is, we provided our own definition and format to ensure consistent style in story generation. This level of customization ensures that the generated stories align with the desired writing style and format, ensuring consistency and coherence in the output. \n",
