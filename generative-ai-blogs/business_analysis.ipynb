    "# An agile kickstart with OpenAI for business analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business analysis process starts with identifying a problem statement and then listing out the high-level business objectives or requirements. We tried to do an agile kickstart for business analysis using AI tools, to expedite the inception phase, enabling rapid requirements gathering. The power of LLMs, large language models, can be used for requirements gathering using API calls to LLMs. With the help of GPT-3.5 chat completion apis's, we were able to engage in an interactive conversation, quickly generating ideas and requirements to kickstart the analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step we used Chat GPT to identify the high-level business objectives for a time tracking application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the problem statement, \n",
    "> Identify top 3 features of a time tracking app for employees to enter work hours against projects so reports can be generated regarding billable hours and then invoices can be created for the billable hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT identified the following 3 high level features:\n",
    ">1. Time Entry and Tracking: The app should have an easy-to-use interface that allows employees to enter their work hours quickly and accurately. The app should also have a timer feature that enables employees to track the time they spend on each project.\n",
    ">2. Reporting: The app should be able to generate detailed reports on the time spent on each project and task, including billable and non-billable hours, and total time spent. These reports should be customizable, allowing for filtering and sorting based on different criteria.\n",
    ">3. Invoicing: The app should be able to create invoices for the billable hours worked on each project. The invoices should be customizable and allow for different billing rate>s and payment terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of business analysis, epics and stories are key components of Agile methodologies, specifically Agile requirements management. They play a vital role in breaking down complex projects into manageable units, ensuring efficient delivery and value creation for stakeholders. During the initial analysis phase, epics are identified from the high-level features, which are then broken down into stories. Subsequently, acceptance criteria for these stories are determined to establish clear guidelines for successful implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the high level features that we had identified to generate epics and stories using prompt engineering techniques. One of the first steps we did was to build a context around how we wanted our epics and stories and acceptance-criterias to be written. Every business analyst will follow a structure and format while writing an epic or a story. Although the GPT model knows what an epic or story is, we provided our own definition and format to ensure consistent style in story generation. This level of customization ensures that the generated stories align with the desired writing style and format, ensuring consistency and coherence in the output.\n",

    "In conclusion, the utilization of Generative AI and the tools built upon it offers significant benefits in expediting the business analysis phase. These AI tools, such as GPT-3.5, provide valuable assistance in quickly identifying problem statements, defining high-level business objectives, and generating epics and user stories. They streamline the requirement gathering process, saving time and effort for business analysts and developers. However, it is important to note that while Generative AI tools are powerful, they may not analyze every aspect comprehensively, and there is a possibility of gaps in the analysis. It is crucial for business analysts and developers to exercise critical thinking and domain expertise to validate and refine the outputs generated by these tools. By combining the strengths of Generative AI with human expertise, we can achieve a more efficient and productive business analysis process, leveraging the AI tools to expedite the initial phases while ensuring thorough analysis through human oversight."
