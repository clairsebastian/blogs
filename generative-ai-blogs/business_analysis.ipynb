    "# An agile kickstart with Generative AI for business analysis\n",
    "Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) tools can significantly expedite the business analysis process. By utilising advanced AI models like GPT, we show how analysts can quickly analyse problem statements, define high-level features and objectives, and generate epics and user stories. AI tools can streamline requirements gathering and save time and effort while enabling structured and organised analysis.\n",
    "We explored how OpenAI's GPT can be leveraged to kickstart the business analysis process and do rapid requirement gathering. You can [read more about the methods and tools used for experimentation.](./an_experiment_with_generative_ai%20copy.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business analysis process starts with identifying a problem statement and then listing out the high-level business goals or requirements. With the help of OpenAI chat completion API's in Python, we were able to engage in an interactive conversation, quickly generating ideas and requirements to kickstart the analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Epics and Stories with Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Epics and stories are key components of breaking down complex projects into manageable units. During the initial analysis phase, epics are identified from the high-level features, which are further broken down into stories. Subsequently, acceptance criteria are written at the story level, telling us specific details to know when we are done.\n",

    "\n",
    "We used GPT to identify the 3 high-level business objectives for a time tracking application. \n",
    "The problem statement was given as a prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Identify top 3 features of a time tracking app for employees to enter work hours against projects so reports can be generated regarding billable hours and then invoices can be created for the billable hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT identified the following 3 high level features:\n",
    ">1. Time Entry and Tracking: The app should have an easy-to-use interface that allows employees to enter their work hours quickly and accurately. The app should also have a timer feature that enables employees to track the time they spend on each project.\n",
    ">2. Reporting: The app should be able to generate detailed reports on the time spent on each project and task, including billable and non-billable hours, and total time spent. These reports should be customizable, allowing for filtering and sorting based on different criteria.\n",
    ">3. Invoicing: The app should be able to create invoices for the billable hours worked on each project. The invoices should be customizable and allow for different billing rates and payment terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used these high level features to generate epics and stories. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Customising AI for Consistent Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Analysts will follow a structure and format while writing an epic or a story. Although the GPT model knows what an epic or user story is, we wanted to provide our own definition and format to ensure consistent style in story generation. A technique we found helpful was to build a structure detailing how we wanted our epics, stories, and acceptance-criteria to be written. This ensures that the generated stories align with the desired writing style and format.\n",

    "Envision each organisation or business analyst defining a customised structure for epics and stories, tailored to their specific needs, and utilising a tool like this to automate the generation of functional and non-functional user stories with acceptance criteria. This ensures that requirements are well-defined and measurable. If the business analyst provides a customised structure and a well-defined problem statement with high-level solutions to such a tool, generating user stories is just a click away. By leveraging this approach, the business analyst can devote their energy to solving the problem at hand, collaborating with others to refine and iterate on the generated output.\n",
    "This tool, with its prompts and customised structure, can be utilised by business analysts across various projects.\n",
    "When custom language models increasingly become the standard, this approach streamlines the process of defining clear and measurable requirements, enabling organisations to achieve faster delivery and greater value creation for stakeholders, all while maintaining a structured and organised approach to requirements management, thus maximising the overall effectiveness of the software application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What lies ahead? \n",
    "The utilisation of Generative AI and the tools built upon it offers significant benefits in expediting the business analysis phase. They streamline the requirement gathering process, saving time and effort for business analysts and developers. However, it is important to note that while Generative AI tools are powerful, they may not analyse every aspect comprehensively, and there is a possibility of gaps in the analysis. It is crucial for business analysts and developers to exercise critical thinking and domain expertise to validate and refine the outputs generated by these tools. By combining the strengths of Generative AI with human expertise, we can achieve a more efficient and productive business analysis process, leveraging the AI tools to expedite the initial phases while ensuring thorough analysis through human oversight.\n"
